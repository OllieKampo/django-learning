Django is a popular web framework that allows developers to quickly spin up a web application. Touted as “the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines,” Django takes care of many low-level functions that can slow the development process.

Django offers out-of-the-box capabilities for routing URLs, authenticating users, and interfacing with databases. This is particularly useful for those who have little to no experience with Structured Query Language (SQL).

SQL is a domain-specific programming language that is used to interact with a relational database management system. Using SQL, one can create, read, update, and remove the records in a given database. However, the intricacies of SQL can be quite complex, and running improper queries can quickly result in the loss of sensitive or irretrievable data.

Django solves this problem by using an object-relational mapper to interface with the database on your behalf. In other words, you tell Django what structure you want the database to have, and Django takes care of translating your Python instructions to SQL queries to be executed on your chosen database. While you can still write SQL if needed, you don’t have to: you simply define your data models in Python, and Django takes care of the rest.

## Migrations

Django translates your Python model into a database table.

In order to go from data model to database table, you’ll need a migration. This is a special type of Python file that contains the instructions that Django needs to create the database table on your behalf.

Django uses your data model to populate these instructions and then runs a migrate command to apply those changes to the database.

In short, Django migrations follow two key steps:

Create a migration file containing instructions for altering the database table
Migrate the database table by running the code contained in the migration file
This two-step process ensures that only the changes you explicitly want to be made are applied. If a migration file contains an error or is missing a critical field, you’re able to correct the issue before applying the changes to the database itself.

This process makes it extremely simple for even junior web developers to interact with a robust database management system. There’s no need for complex SQL queries or to use a browser-based management console to change the database.
